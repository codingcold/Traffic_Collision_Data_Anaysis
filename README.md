# Traffic_Collision_Data_Anaysis
The first time I arrived in Los Angeles, I could feel its prosperity. And when I drive in the freeways I can see the busy roads and crowded traffic streams. I also happened to see some traffic collisions while driving. Big trunk or small vehicle, young teenagers or old man drivers. I started to wonder what factors account for these traffic collisions. Maybe because of the weather, the age of the driver, the humidity or temperature of that day or the level of prosperity in that specific area. There are many things I can come up with. In this article I took population density into account and analyzed the relationship between the frequency of traffic collisions happening and the population density in that particular zip code. Because more population in some way indicates that there are more people and more vehicles and in common sense it will lead to more traffic collisions.
